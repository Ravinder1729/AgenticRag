# SQL_agentic_chatbot – Business & Technical Overview
-   **Business Use Case** – This repository provides a robust solution for enabling non-technical users to interact with SQL databases using natural language. It solves the challenge of direct SQL query writing, allowing business users, data analysts, and developers to retrieve information effortlessly through intuitive chatbot interfaces. This facilitates quicker data access and decision-making by democratizing database querying capabilities.
-   **Product Context** – This repository serves as a self-contained collection of Python scripts demonstrating and implementing Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) capabilities using Google Generative AI, LangChain, and LangGraph. Based on the provided information, it functions as a standalone system for database querying via natural language, without explicit dependencies on larger platform flows like `doc_jobs`, background generation services, or specific GCS outputs.

## Key Features & Capabilities
*   Enables Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) conversion.
*   Integrates with Google Generative AI (Gemini) for natural language understanding and generation.
*   Leverages the LangChain and LangGraph frameworks for agentic workflows.
*   Supports querying both SQLite and PostgreSQL databases.
*   Provides Streamlit-based chatbot interfaces for user interaction.
*   Includes utilities for setting up and populating databases with sample data from CSV files.
*   Implements LLM-based SQL query validation to enhance system robustness.
*   Manages multi-step, stateful conversational workflows using LangGraph.
*   Enforces structured output formats for LLM-generated content using `TypedDict`.
*   Utilizes asynchronous processing to maintain application responsiveness.
*   Offers comprehensive tracing, debugging, and monitoring capabilities via LangSmith.

-   **End-to-End Sequence**
    1.  Initial database setup and population from CSV files (e.g., `daily_sales.csv`, `dress_stocks.csv`) using scripts like `postconnection.py`, `link.py`, `linkgre.py`, or `linkcsv.py`.
    2.  User interacts with a Streamlit-based chatbot interface (e.g., `chatbot.py`, `chatbot_querycheck.py`).
    3.  The natural language user question is received and processed by a LangChain/LangGraph agent.
    4.  Google Generative AI (Gemini) translates the natural language question into an executable SQL query.
    5.  (In some implementations) The generated SQL query undergoes validation by an LLM against common mistakes.
    6.  The validated SQL query is executed against the configured SQLite or PostgreSQL database.
    7.  Results are retrieved from the database.
    8.  Google Generative AI synthesizes a natural language answer based on the query results.
    9.  The natural language answer is presented to the user via the chatbot interface.

## Getting Started
1.  **Prerequisites**
    *   Python 3.x (exact version not specified, but required for all Python projects).
    *   Access to Google Generative AI (Gemini API key is required for LLM interaction).
    *   A local or remote SQLite and/or PostgreSQL database instance.
    *   Required Python packages: `asyncio`, `datetime`, `dotenv`, `getpass`, `langchain`, `langchain_community` (including `agent_toolkits.sql.base.SQLAgentExecutor`, `tools.sql_database.tool.QuerySQLDatabaseTool`, `utilities.SQLDatabase`), `langchain_core` (including `output_parsers.StrOutputParser`, `prompts.ChatPromptTemplate`, `runnables.RunnablePassthrough`), `langchain_google_genai`, `langgraph` (including `checkpoint.memory.MemorySaver`, `graph.START`, `graph.StateGraph`), `logging`, `os`, `pandas`, `psycopg2` (implicitly for PostgreSQL), `re`, `sqlalchemy`, `streamlit`, `time`, `typing_extensions` (including `Annotated`, `TypedDict`).
    *   Input data files located at `docs/daily_sales.csv`, `docs/dress_stocks.csv`, and a target SQLite database file at `docs/shopping.db`.
2.  **Configuration**
    *   API keys and other sensitive information, such as database credentials, should be managed securely. It is recommended to use environment variables, loaded via `dotenv`, to avoid hardcoding sensitive data within the repository. Refer to individual script implementations for specific environment variable requirements.
3.  **Installation & Launch**
    *   Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
    *   Navigate into the repository directory: `cd SQL_agentic_chatbot`
    *   Install required Python dependencies (it is recommended to create a `requirements.txt` file from the listed dependencies): `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    *   Launch a specific Streamlit-based chatbot interface, for example: `streamlit run chatbot.py` or `streamlit run chatbot_querycheck.py`.
    *   For core agent logic demonstrations without a Streamlit UI, execute relevant Python scripts directly, e.g.: `python query_check.py`.
4.  **Viewing & Exporting Docs**
    *   Interact with the running Streamlit chatbot application through your web browser, typically accessible at `http://localhost:8501`. The chatbot will display natural language answers based on your queries directly within the interface. This repository focuses on interactive querying, and does not provide specific functionalities for exporting documentation or conversation logs in formats like PDF or HTML.

## Contributing & Extension
-   Extensions to this folder are appropriate when introducing new database schemas or tables for natural language querying, updating data loading procedures or enhancing existing datasets, integrating newer versions of Large Language Models or experimenting with different prompt engineering strategies, adding new features or improving the user experience of the Streamlit chatbot interfaces, enhancing the accuracy or robustness of SQL query generation and validation logic, extending support to new database types beyond SQLite and PostgreSQL, or incorporating updates or new patterns from the LangChain and LangGraph frameworks.
-   Contributions should adhere to standard software development best practices, including creating feature branches, submitting pull requests for review, and ensuring all changes are thoroughly tested. Specific branching, testing, and review processes are not detailed in the provided folder documentation.

## Security & Compliance
-   Sensitive information, such as Google Generative AI API keys and database credentials, must never be stored directly within the repository. These should always be managed through environment variables or secure configuration mechanisms (e.g., using `dotenv`).
-   The system incorporates a dedicated step for SQL query validation using an LLM in certain pipelines (`chatbot_querycheck.py`, `query_check.py`, `sql_agent.py`), which acts as a built-in guardrail to enhance the robustness and correctness of generated queries by identifying and mitigating common mistakes.
